    \it{Abstract.}
    Suppose $m$ players select from a pool $\U$ of $n$ elements without replacement and with the additional restriction that their selections are limited to subsets $\U_1, \ldots, \U_m \subseteq \U$, respectively.
    When the $U_i$'s only partially intersect, a prior player's selection may not affect all the players coming after them.
    Further, by changing the order that the $m$ players draw from the pool, we may increase or decrease the probability of an element being chosen once it reaches a later player.
    What ordering will yield the most uniform probabilities for every player?
    In this paper, we answer this for the $2$-player case and show that being ``greedy'' in our ordering may not yield optimal results for a very specific instance of a $10$-person case through empirical results.}
