\section{Conclusions and Outlook}\label{Section:Outlook}
We began with the very general question ``What is the best ordering for our players?''.
In completing the proof that the greedy ordering works best when there are two players, we got stuck trying to carry forward our techniques on the cases with more players.
As such, we set out to find empirical evidence that perhaps the greedy ordering is optimal for more than two players as well.
In doing so, we find that simulating this game takes an extremely long time, and as a result, created a neural network that would handle the simulations.
With that said and done, we find empirical evidence suggesting the opposite of what we set out to show: the greedy ordering is \it{not} optimal (at least for our restricted case of $152$ elements and $10$ players).
This leaves us with one last follow-up question: if the greedy ordering isn't the best ordering, what other mechanisms are at play that will determine the best ordering?

Overall, we've built some useful tools to perform empirical analysis on this problem.
In particular, the network can always be tweaked to accept different instances of our problem.
This is also the weakness of our tool as it lacks generality.
Indeed, we still lack a good grasp of the mathematics behind our problem and future research should focus on this aspect.
